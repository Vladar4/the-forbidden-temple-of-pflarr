Hidden deep in the mountains of Hutaaka Valley, the ancient temple of Pflarr stood undisturbed for centuries.

Now, something dark has awakened there. The evil force within crawls through the dusty halls, trying to make its escape.

\vfill

\chapter{The Valley}
\label{ch:valley}

\section{Information for the Dungeon Master}

\subsection{In Ages Past}

Long ago, at the highest point of the Hutaakan civilization, a high priest fell under the corrupting influence of Thanatos\dash the most hated enemy of Pflarr, immortal patron of the jackal-headed Hutaakans. The corruption was noticed in time. Hutaakan clergy captured the heretic and, lest Thanatos's servant rise as his undead minion, sealed him alive in a stone sarcophagus hidden in his own temple.

\tab The story of the forbidden temple was lost during the decline of the Hutaakan culture. The reason the temple was abandoned is long forgotten, even by the priests of Pflarr.

\subsection{Current Times}

\tab The tribe that the characters allied with during the events of \emph{B10: Night's Dark Terror} now fully controls the western half of the Lost Valley, but Eastern Hutaaka is still uninhabited since neither Hutaakans nor Traldar have the numbers to resettle there. The other tribe is scattered and nearly extinct by this point.

\tab Not long ago, a lone group of Traldar discovered the temple and entered it, unknowingly freeing the high priest, who immediately rewarded them with a quick and painful death. Still confined by the holy walls of the temple, the high priest now sends his ghouls to bring him new victims, while attempting to perform a dark ritual that will set him free.

\break

\section{Rumors for the Player Characters}

It is said that the forested mountains to the northeast of the central lake hide an ancient temple of Pflarr\dash one of the oldest structures in the valley. It was abandoned so long ago that even the Hutaakans themselves don't remember the reason why.

\tab Each character also knows a single random rumor about the temple:

\paragraph{d10 Rumors}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Forests near the northern road are teeming with the undead. \textbf{(True)}
	\item An ancient secluded colony of Hutaakans lives in the northern mountains. \textbf{(False)}
	\item The temple was nearly destroyed in a large earthquake hundreds of years ago. \textbf{(False)}
	\item You must approach the temple on all fours, lest the monuments of Pflarr at the entrance smite you dead right there. \textbf{(False)}
	\item Statues of Hutaakan priests can come alive to smite intruders. \textbf{(True)}
	\item The temple is full of precious objects of the ancient Hutaakan culture. \textbf{(True)}
	\item If you listen carefully, you can hear ancient mummified priests whispering prayers to Pflarr. \textbf{(False)}
	\item Anyone staying in the temple for a~night turns into a jackal-headed monstrosity. \textbf{(False)}
	\item The temple is said to be carved right into the cliff face. \textbf{(True)}
	\item The temple is full of deadly traps and hidden passages. \textbf{(True)}
\end{enumerate}

\break

\section{Hutaakans}

In ancient times these tall and slender jackal-headed humanoids were a civili- zed race obsessed with cultural and religious pursuits, crafts, and trade. Now the fading remains of their people live in isolated communities in the western part of the Lost Valley of Hutaaka.

\section{Traldar}

Former Hutaakan slaves, they are cruel and embittered people, often aggressive and bloodthirsty in battle. Traldar are mostly short, muscular, and almost hairless, except for the backs of their large, strong hands.

\section{Ancient Ruins}

\paragraph{Villages}

A dozen single-story stone domiciles of a few rooms each. Some are free- standing, while others are built into the rock.

\paragraph{Other Structures}
Stone shrines of Pflarr, fountains, and decorated arches are scattered throughout the valley. Since the time of the Traldar uprising, nearly all decorations have been smashed and erased, leaving almost no trace of the Hutaakan craftsmanship.

\chapter{The Temple}

\section{General Notes}

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
\item
All lesser undead are of Traldar origin, warriors turned into elder ghouls, vocals into agarats, and others into ghouls.
\item
The whole interior (from \hyperlink{room5}{\textbf{room 5}} and on) is completely \textbf{devoid of light}.
\item
\textbf{Halls} are 30' high, \textbf{chambers} \dash\ 20', \textbf{corridors} and \textbf{doorways} \dash\ 15' high.
\item
\textbf{Living Statues} stood dormant for millennia and were reanimated just recently by the high priest's will.
\item
No random encounters happen in the temple, but ghouls from the nearby rooms can hear loud noises and come out to investigate.
\item
At night, the high priest comes out, accompanied by his servants (see \hyperlink{room14}{\textbf{room 14}}), and travels to \hyperlink{room9}{\textbf{room 9}} to animate new undead servants if the dead bodies are available.
\end{itemize}


\hypertarget{room1}{}
\section{1. Entrance}

A pair of colossal jackal-headed sculptures of Pflarr sit on either side of an open dark entrance. They are sculpted out of the rock face, like the entire temple.


\hypertarget{room2}{}
\section{2. Traldar Camp}

Abandoned campsite, old fire pit,\\dirty and tattered lizard skins lying around.
If the camp is searched thoroughly, a small leather bag with \textbf{20~ep} can be found.


\hypertarget{room3}{}
\section{3. Collapsed Building}

A skeleton of a Hutaakan priest is buried under the rubble. Any noise will attract 2d4 \hyperlink{ghoul}{\textbf{ghouls}} skulking nearby, who will try to ambush the party.

\skipline
\paragraph{Buried Treasure}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
	\item thin silver bracelets (2 Ã 50 gp)

\end{textbox}


\hypertarget{room4}{}
\section{4. The Seal of Pflarr}

An ancient star-shaped holy symbol carved on the floor in front of the entrance still works, blocking undead over 4 HD from leaving the temple.


\hypertarget{room5}{}
\section{5. Outer Hall}

Stucco reliefs that were once covering the walls now lie broken and smashed on the floor. It would take a great amount of time and effort to reassemble some of them back together. If it is done, the characters will see scenes depicting the Hutaakan creation myth: Pflarr sculpting his jackal-headed Hutaakan children out of dust and gifting them with the breath of life.

\tab Six square 10'-wide \textbf{columns} adorned with masterful reliefs of jackal-headed figures engaged in various forms of arts and crafts.

\tab Six \hyperlink{statue}{\textbf{jade living statues}} 10' tall, each one standing near a column, will attack any intruders on sight.

\tab Loud noises have a 2-in-6 chance (check each combat round) of attracting the inhabitants of \hyperlink{room8}{\textbf{room 8}}.

\section{6. Right-Hand Corridor}

3 \hyperlink{statue}{\textbf{rock/ooze living statues}} stand in corners, camouflaged as parts of bas- reliefs covering stone walls, and will attack once anyone walks to the center of the room, having a normal chance of ambushing the party, if no such statues were encountered before.

\tab The door to \hyperlink{room7}{\textbf{room 7}} stands open.

\end{textbox}


\hypertarget{room7}{}
\section{7. Defiled Burial Chamber}

Three sarcophagi lie open, their lids scattered on the floor. Half-smashed reliefs on the walls tell a story of Hutaakan clerics defeating the corrupted high priest and burying him alive in this sacred place to stop the spread of evil.

\tab When the Traldar broke into the temple, they first came here, unknow- ingly breaking the sacred seals that kept the high priest confined. The other two sarcophagi were of his apprentices, now serving their undead master in \hyperlink{room14}{\textbf{room 14}}.
